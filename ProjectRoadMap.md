Project Road Map for IS 3020 Project
Project Road Map for Order Stager
For project in IS 3020
The best example of code that could relate to what I am doing for this project was a BMI calculator. For the project, I want to change it to be able to enter height,length, and potentially weight of an object and then prompt the user where merchandise should be displayed.Ideally, I also want to have a set number each area can have merchandise staged in, so that areas do not get merchandise in them that are already filled. The code base is similar to a calculator, so the main thing that will be changed is the output going from spitting out numbers to arbitrary locations of a store. The program can be used in basic form by employees that will assist them in effectively staging products to efficiently serve our customers with online orders.
