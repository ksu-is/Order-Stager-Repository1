# Order Stager Repository README
This is a simple body mass index measurer written in Python. I have forked the info used for it and plan on manipulating the code so it can be used for an order stager in a department store. Instead of entering height and weight to receive a BMI score, the user of the code will enter the width and height (potentially weight also) of merchandise purchased by a customer and prompt them where to stage the items so they can be retrieved when the customer arrives to pick them up.Here is a rough timeline of events for this I anticipate or ones I think a company could use.
Week 0-1:Find code repository that resembles our online order staging needs and ensure code is relevant-Done, using PyBMI and saw how it can be applicable for company's needs
Week 1-3: Work on code to our uses and build a prototype with it to stage orders-work in progress
Week 3-4: Work through kinks on system and add nuances to it(weight,backup-locations,etc.)
Week 5: Fine tune and present our findings 
Week 6: Test further and get go ahead from higher ups
Week 7: Goto Market
## Usage
